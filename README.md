A Brick Breaker game in Java is a popular arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to keep a ball in play while breaking a series of bricks arranged at the top of the screen. The game involves bouncing the ball off the paddle to hit and destroy bricks. As the ball bounces off the bricks, they disappear, and the goal is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle. The paddle moves horizontally, and the ball follows a trajectory influenced by where it hits the paddle, walls, or bricks. The game typically features smooth animations, collision detection, and increasing levels of difficulty, making it engaging and interactive.
